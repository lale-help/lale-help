#
# "The primary syntax provided by rspec-expectations is based on
# the expect method, which explicitly wraps an object or block
# of code in order to set an expectation on it.

# There's also an older should-based syntax, which relies upon should being
# monkey-patched onto every object in the system. However, this syntax can at times lead to
# some surprising failures, since RSpec does not own every object in the system and cannot
# guarantee that it will always work consistently."
